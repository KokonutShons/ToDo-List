# ToDo-List
The purpose for this project was to make a personal to-do list and notes application.
This project is a To-Do List application made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Build
Develop the HTML file, adding CSS styling on the way as desired, and develop the JavaScript file to make it all work. 
Once having developed the files or to check how the application looks while working on it, there are a couple simple methods to do so.
> Recommended: If developing the code using Visual Studio Code, there is an extention that is very convenient with handling the launching of live servers. 
> Install the *Live Server* extension on VSCode by Ritwick Dey.
> You can now: 
> Click "Go Live" on the bottom right corner of VSCode, then right click on `index.html` and click "Open with Live Server {CMD+L + CMD+O}"
> Note: Opening with Live Server could be done without clicking "Go Live" button
> Now the application will be displayed in your server through a connection through one of your device's port.
Note that opening up a live server connection does not strictly have to be on the Live Server extension or in VSCode at all. 
If starting a Live Server is something you do not want to or cannot do:
> Navigate to the project directory on your device's file navigation system.
> _Open_ or *Open With **_Browser_*** to view the application in your browser locally. 
Chenge the RGB color values and other CSS componenets to customize the list to how you want it to look!
